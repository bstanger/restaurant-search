/******* Question 1: *********************************************************/
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers,
George

Hi George,

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with those concepts!

Records: Records are the items stored in an index.  A record is a JSON schemaless
object you wish to make searchable that you add to your index. Each attribute in a
record can be used for searching, displaying, filtering, or ranking.  For example,
if I were to build an index of various holidays celebrated in the US, perhaps a
single record from this index would look like this:

{
  id: 49270,
  name: 'Halloween',
  date: 10-31
}

Indexing: Indexing is the process of uploading and analyzing a dataset so as to
allow for fast searches in the future.  To begin the indexing process, you would
pass your dataset to us and indicate which of the fields in your dataset are needed
to search, display, filter, and rank your data.  We then analyze and store, or index,
the data in the best way possible to allow for fast searches.

In terms of metrics for Custom Ranking, you would want to select metrics that would
help us bring the most relevant records to the top of the search results for your users.
For example, in our example holidays index perhaps you would want the date to be
included as a Custom Ranking metric so that the upcoming holidays (eg 4th of July)
show up top in the search.

I hope that helps!  If you have any follow up or additional questions, don't hesitate
to let me know.

Best,
Becca





/******* Question 2: *********************************************************/
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

Hi Matt,

I'm sorry to hear that!  Our intention with adding the additional clicks to clear indices was to help users avoid accidentally clearing their indices, but I could understand that change being frustrating if you already had the steps necessary built in to your iterative process.

Best,
Becca

Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?
